## 5(a). This is the register page where the user has to register to get in to the application and it is both for the vendors and users and for differentiating i have made one select option in this page both for the vendor and member and according to that it will be stored in the database as a role.

## 5(c). This is the success message will be shown when the user or vendor is registered along with their username and for this the connect-flash module has been used and for interacting to the express application i have used express-messages

## 6(a). This is the login page where the user has to type the username and password which they have given while registering and then the member or vendor can enter in to the application.

## 6(b). The login form is also validated and if the username and password doesnt match from the database then it will show this error and for this passport-authentication module has been used the middleware has been added in the app.js file and for the password since it is not safe to keep it a plain text the bcrypt module has been used so the password will be stored in the database encrypted so no one can able to exploit it and enter in to the application.

## 6(c). This is the success message after the login will be shown along with the username and after login session will be created for that member or vendor and it is gets expired then again we have to login to get in to the application since it is authenticated so without login no one can see this page.In this page there are 3 links which are Vendor, Member and Logout.

## 7. This is the members page the user who has chosen the role for member will be shown here to along with their username,name and their id from the mongodb database which is generated by the mongodb database so only the members will be shown here not the vendors.

## 8. Since we know that both the members and vendors have registered through the same form but the difference was their role so if the user is vendor for them this the login form only for the vendors no member can enter in to the vendor dashboard since in this login form a secret code has been given to all the vendors since they are selling their products here in the application so only the code will be provided to them and for this different collection of vendor has been created in the database for storing their data and showing in the git cmd.The secret code is "secretCode123" type this and then you will be directed to the homepage of the vendor.

## 9. This is the homepage for the vendor which will be shown only when the user give the right secretcode otherwise it will be not shown since it is authenticated to only the vendors and not for the members.

## 10. This is the dashboard for all the vendors that has been registered to this application will be shown in this page along with their username,name and their role and also their id which will be given by the mongodb database for refernce.Since after looking in to the dashboard it gets you back to the vendor login page since it is authenticated so again you have to logged in to see the next page which is the products page.
